Description
-----------
The Kinect Dressing Room is a project in which a user is able to try on clothes 
virtually using the Kinect. In the downloads above an executable is 
provided. Opening this with a Kinect connected to your computer, allows you to try 
the Kinect Dressing Room yourself:  
- When starting the application, choose a 4:3 resolution.  
- Calibrate by taking the calibration pose for the Kinect.  
- After the indicator turns green, hand icons will appear.  
- Select and deselect clothing by hover over the buttons on the left.  

The entire project is downloadable by downloading the source code. For this application 
Unity 3D is used as 3D environment. Most of the code is written in csharp and c++. When 
Unity is installed on your computer, you can open the Unity Project by selecting the 
Kinect-DressingRoom folder as project folder.
